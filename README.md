## Installing and running the app

1. Clone the repo
````bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ldgarcia/reactnd-project-readable
$ cd reactnd-project-readable
````

2. Install and start the API server:
````bash
$ cd api-server
$ npm install
$ node server
````
By default, the server runs on port `http://localhost:3001/`. You can change this by setting the `SERVER_PORT` and `SERVER_ORIGIN` environment variables.

3. In another terminal window, install and start the frontend:
````bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
Likewise, by default, the client sets the server address at `http://localhost:3001/`. You can change this by setting the same environment variables as above.
